# Year-1-OOSD
This is a group Project for my OOSD coursework. Working on this assignment will help me understand more clearly the concepts, problems, and techniques of basic object-oriented programming, and how these can be used to design and implement a simple problem while working in a team. The aim of this project is to create a software system Car Parts and Accessories shop to keep track of stock items and prices. This project is created on Netbeans with the programming language of Java.
